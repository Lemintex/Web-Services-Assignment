# Web Services Assignment
## What is this?
This is a university assignment where I was tasked with creating a REsTful API allowing users and admins to individually access parts of the service relevant to their access level. This implementation uses Spring and Springboot, and has security features like https and API keys (albeit plaintext ones) worked into the service.
# What mark did you get for this?
For the code part of this assignment I scored 77% which I was very happy with.
